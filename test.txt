Người 1: What the f*ck is wrong with you?
Người 2: Don't talk to me like that, I didn't do anything.
Người 1: You always f*ck things up, it's annoying.
Người 2: If you don't like it, do it yourself. I'm not your servant.
Người 1: Just f*ck off! I'm done dealing with this.
Người 2: Whatever, f*ck you too.
